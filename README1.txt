Source for Bertrand '88 Beta distribution.

The documentation has been converted from troff to html. See
Reference.html and Guide.html.

The directory "libraries" contains the bertrand libraries, and
the directory "examples" contains a small number of examples.
Other examples can be typed in from the book.  I'd appreciate
copies of interesting programs that you write in Bertrand.

The file graphics.h was generated automatically from graphics.cps
by the program cps (which comes with the NeWS window system from
Sun Microsystems).  If you do not have NeWS, you will need to
rewrite graphics.c and ignore graphics.h and graphics.cps.  These
files are pretty simple, actually.

There is also graphicsnull.c, that simulates a graphics device
but just prints out everything rather than drawing it.

Have fun!
